            %p According to the FBI, a burglary takes place approximately every 14 seconds. The best way to protect your family, home, and business is with a monitored security system. Statistically, you are three times less likely to become a burglary victim when you protect your home or business with a monitored security system. In addition to avoiding burglaries, monitored security systems can also save you up to 20% on your insurance policy!
