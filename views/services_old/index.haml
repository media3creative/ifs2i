              %br
              The Baikal lake is the place of superlatives: the deepest of the world, the oldest, the clearest, the purest, the largest biodiversity and the grossest volume (20% of the total) of sweet water of the world. From all reasons, the Baikal lake is a part of the world inheritance of Unesco.

            %p It is particularly interesting to see the Baikal lake. If you travel with the Trans-Siberian.

              %b Geography:
              %br
              Baikal is the biggest lake of Eurasia and the deepest of the world (1, 620 meters). The lake is the most impressive phenomenon of nature, Baikal is as big that all rivers of the world need a year to full it. Only a few people are able to understand, that the lake is located in a very beautiful region. In winter the lake becomes frozen and the ice is so thick and strong that the Trans-Siberian can cross it. In summer its crystal clear water is transparent to 40 meters deep and the lakesides are adorned with the season colors. Voyages that are usually organized within a warm season are the best way to discover the lake through walks in forests, parks, and naturals reserves.
            %p
              %b Climate:
              %br
              The Siberian winter is very cold. However the lake collects energy during the summer what influences a winter temperature. The lake is frozen in winter. At some north places it thaws out only in May. Usually in summer tourists have a stop at the lakeside. From year to year number of tourists increases with the people who would like to discover the Siberian winter and to see the transparence of the lake under ice.
